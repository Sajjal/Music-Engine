# Welcome

### Thank you for exploring S & D Music Engine.

It is a web-based Music Streaming application that downloads Youtube video in the server, converts it into mp3 audio and stream the audio track back to the end user's device.

This application is developed using Node.js, Express.js, HTML and CSS. MongoDB is used as a database. The user interface is optimized for iPhone X.

**Feel free to Clone and Fork. Commercial Distribution is Prohibited.**

## Background (_Why this application was developed?_)

This project was in consideration during the development of **Covid-19-Analyzer** `https://github.com/Sajjal/Covid-19-Analyzer` After completing **Daily Journal** `https://github.com/Sajjal/Daily-Journal` I started working on it.

This project was supposed to be completed a few days ago. But recently, I started my summer internship (remote) with FireSide Solutions, LLC and I was not able to dedicate enough time to this project.

As they say, better late than never; and here it is.
